# It is possible to connect a container to a web app, by using:
    "docker.host.machine" on the url of your app

# It is also possible to create a container with a MongoDB database inside it, just use:
    docker pull mongo 

    And start a container using:
        docker start mongo
    
# Whe interconnecting 2 containers it is possible via the IPAdress of one another:
    you can get this info using:
        docker container inspect <CONTAINER_NAME>

        and then search for the "IPAdress" key inside that dictionary

# Container Networks allows containers to communicate between them, you can add container to a network by adding:
    --network <MY_NETWORK>

    to yor docker run command

    With a Docker network, all containers can communicate with each other and IPs are automatically resolved

    To create a Container network use the following command:
        docker network create <NETWORK_NAME>

    You can check all the networks created by using:
        docker nework ls
    
    *Inside a web app container, you can connect a mongodb container to it by adding the container's name to the url, once they are both in the same network

    Docker neworks actually support different kinds of "Drivers" which influence the behavior of the Network.
    The default driver is the "bridge" diver. It provides the behavior shown in this module.
    The driver can be set when a Network is created, simply by adding the --driver option.
        docker network create --driver bridge <NETWORK_NAME>

    Of course if you want to use the "bridge" driver. you can simply omit the entire option since "bridge" is the default option.
    Docker also supports these alternative drivers - though you will use the "bridge" driver in most cases:
        - host: For standalone containers, isolation between container and host system is removed.
        - overlay: Multiple Docker daemons are able to connect with each other. Only works in "Swarm" mode which is a dated/almost deprecated way of connecting multiple containers
        - none: All networking is disabled
        - Third-party plugins: You can install third-party plugins which then may add all kinds of behaviors and functionalities
