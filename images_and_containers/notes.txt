# As an example, there are predefined images in the docker.com page, in this example we will use the node images
    - To download the Node.JS image, one can do it by going to the docker page and search for it, then download it
        #In case of linux users, you can download it only by typing:
            - docker run node
        # This will download the latest version of it
    - The comand to check the latest container created is:
        - docker ps -an
        #This will show you all the container previously created, along their names , date and status
    - To create an interactive session in this Node Container, you can use the following command:
        - docker run -it node
        #This will allow you to type commands and get a response, such as if you were inside an interpreter
    - To check you Node version, you can type:
        - node -v
        #For this you need to have nodejs previously installed

# By running docker --help you can get a list of commands you can run in docker
# if you want to see all the containers that are currenty runnung use: docker ps
# To see all the containers previously creeated use: docker ps -a
# "docker run" creates a new container
# To restart a container previously stopped use: docker start <container_name>
# Attaching to an already-running Container
    - By default, if you run a Container without -d, you run in "attached mode". 
        Which menas you are always listening what the app recieves, therefore it blocks the terminal you are using
    - If you started a container in detached mode(i.e. with -d) you can still attach to it afterwards withoput restarting the Container with the following command:
        docker attach <CONTAINER_NAME>

# When creating a non-web app like in python, c++, go, etc, it is posible to create an image and a container and also interact with them iside the container by adding the arguments -i and -t when running it:
    docker run -i -t <container>

    - After finishing the app's run, the container will stop by itself
    - If you want to start the container you need to attach yourself to it, but consider to add the -i argument to attach to it in an interactive mode
