Dockerize BOTH apps - the Python and Node app

1) Create appropiate images for both apps (two separate images!).
HINT: Have brief look at the app code to configure your images correctly!

Answers (just command line):
    1) (inside node-app folder) docker build .
    2) (inside python-app folder) docker build .

2)Launch a continer for each created image, making sure,
that the app inside the container works correctly and is usable.

Answers:
    1) docker run -p 3000:3000 <image_name>
    2) docker run -i -t <image_name>

3)Re-create both containers and assign names to both containers,
clean-up all created images.

Answers:
    1) docker run -p 3000:3000 --name <name_of_your_choice> <image_name>
    2) docker run -i -t --name <name_of_your_choice> <image_name>

4) Clean up (remove) all stopped (and running) containers,
clean up all created images.

Answers:
    For stopped containers:
    1) docker rm <container_name>
    For running containers:
    1) docker stop <container_name>
    2) docker rm <container_name
    For Images:
    1) docker rmi <image_name> 

5)Re-build images - this time with names and tags assigned to them

Answers:
    1) docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .

6)Run new containers based on the re-built images, ensuring that the containers are removed automatically when stopped

Answers:
    1) docker run -p 3000:3000 -d(for detached) --rm --name <container_name> <image_name>:<tag>
    2) docker run -i -t --rm --name <container_name> <image_name>:<tag>
